## Description


**Storytale: Adventures with You and Your Pet** is an interactive storybook app, built for the Nano Banana Hackathon, that harnesses Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) for rapid, high-fidelity AI image generation. The app immerses users and their pets as main characters in beautifully illustrated, anime-style narratives.

- **Real-Time Interactivity:** Dynamic, prompt-driven image regeneration enables pose changes, facial expression control, style transfer, weather adaptation, and seamless background integration.  
- **Personalized Storytelling:** Characters are generated and adapted on empty backgrounds, then composited into vivid settings—ranging from neon-lit cities to snowy mountains.  
- **Cohesive Art Direction:** Applies a “K-pop Demon Hunters” style across every page with robust scene adaptation and visual continuity.  
- **Collectible Figurines:** Users can generate toy-like renders of their storybook heroes.  
- **Powered by Gemini & Nano Banana:** Demonstrates the real-time speed and creative flexibility of Gemini’s image models for interactive, image-driven apps.
